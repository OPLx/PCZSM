[PCZSM v1.00 by OPLx]
---------------------
PCZSM is a DOS based player of the ZSM format originally targeted for the
Commander X16 platform.

The main purpose is to provide an example of how to use some of the features

Philips SAA1099 sound chips.

* YM2151 clocked at 4 MHz frequency conversion.
* SAA1099 clocked at 8 MHz frequency conversion.
* VERA PCM playback.
* VERA PSG Pulse Width (SAA1099 natively lacks this feature).

  the dual SAA1099 chips.
